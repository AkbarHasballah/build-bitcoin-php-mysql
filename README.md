### About The Project
In this tutorial we will code from zero to form a basic features of working cryptocurrency. Most of work meets minimal working requirement and aims for simplicity and easy understanding.

We are using `PHP` and `MYSQL `mainly for backend, and a little bit `Jquery` when come to frontend.

This project is not ready for production launching, but rather we try to show you the basic principles of cryptocurrency that can be implemented in a concise way.

I hope this tutorial is helpful to you to step into blockchain development.
