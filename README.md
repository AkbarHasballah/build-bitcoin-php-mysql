### About The Project
In this tutorial we will code from zero to form a basic features of working cryptocurrency. Most of work meets minimal working requirement and aims for simplicity and easy understanding.

We are using PHP and MYSQL mainly for backend, and a little bit jquery when come to frontend.

The final version of this project is by no means a “production ready” implementation of a cryptocurrency, but rather tries to show that the basic principles in a cryptocurrency can be implemented in a concise way.

I hope this tutorial will help you understand more of the technical aspects of a cryptocurrency.
